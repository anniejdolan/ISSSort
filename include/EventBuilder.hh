/*!
* \brief Builds physics events after all hits have been time sorted.
*
* \details The ISSEventBuilder Class takes a list of time-sorted events from all of the detectors, and packages them up into a series of physics events. The time-sorted events are looped over, and each different data type (ASIC/CAEN/INFO) is dealt with appropriately, and stored as their respective different data types. Any ASIC or CAEN hit above threshold is able to open an event window (specified by the user in the settings file which goes with the ISSSettings class). The next entry in the tree is probed in order to work out whether the event window should be closed. 
*
* When the event window closes, each detector has its own "finder function": ISSEventBuilder::ArrayFinder, ISSEventBuilder::RecoilFinder, ISSEventBuilder::MwpcFinder, ISSEventBuilder::ElumFinder, and ISSEventBuilder::ZeroDegreeFinder. These functions process the events on each detector, imposing prompt coincidence conditions amongst other sanity checks. Once processed, all of these hits on the different detectors are packaged up into a single event in an ISSEvts tree.
* The constructor for this class requires an ISSSettings object, which allows it to use parameters defined in the "settings.dat" file. This includes:
* - Settings which encode the wiring of the detectors e.g. the number of CAEN modules used.
* - The size of the event window used to combine events
*
* This size of the event window is crucial for determining which signals belong to which events. The default parameter for this is 3 microseconds *which is currently a blind choice that seems to work*. Perhaps you, dear reader, can come up with a more rigorous reason!
